# Cursor Code Guidelines

## Implementation Best Practices

### 0 — Purpose  

These rules ensure maintainability, safety, and developer velocity. 
**MUST** rules are enforced by CI; **SHOULD** rules are strongly recommended.

---

### 1 — Before Coding

- **BP-1 (MUST)** Ask the user clarifying questions.
- **BP-2 (SHOULD)** Draft and confirm an approach for complex work.  
- **BP-3 (SHOULD)** If ≥ 2 approaches exist, list clear pros and cons.

---

### 2 — While Coding

- **C-1 (MUST)** Follow TDD: scaffold stub -> write failing test -> implement.
- **C-2 (MUST)** Name functions with existing domain vocabulary for consistency.  
- **C-3 (SHOULD NOT)** Introduce classes when small testable functions suffice.  
- **C-4 (SHOULD)** Prefer simple, composable, testable functions.
- **C-5 (MUST)** Prefer branded `type`s for IDs **that are persisted in a database or exchanged with external APIs**
  ```ts
  type UserId = Brand<string, 'UserId'>   // ✅ Good
  type UserId = string                    // ❌ Bad
  ```  
- **C-6 (MUST)** Use `import type { … }` for type-only imports.
- **C-7 (SHOULD)** Keep code self-explanatory; add high-level JSDoc comments for all exported functions and critical caveats. Avoid noisy inline comments.
- **C-8 (SHOULD)** Default to `type`; use `interface` only when more readable or interface merging is required. 
- **C-9 (SHOULD NOT)** Extract a new function unless it will be reused elsewhere, is the only way to unit-test otherwise untestable logic, or drastically improves readability of an opaque block.

---

### 3 — Testing

- **T-1 (MUST)** For a simple function, colocate unit tests in `*.spec.ts` in same directory as source file.
- **T-2 (MUST)** For any API change, add/extend integration tests in `packages/api/test/*.spec.ts`.
- **T-3 (MUST)** ALWAYS separate pure-logic unit tests from DB-touching integration tests.
- **T-4 (SHOULD)** Prefer integration tests over heavy mocking.  
- **T-5 (SHOULD)** Unit-test complex algorithms thoroughly.
- **T-6 (SHOULD)** Test the entire structure in one assertion if possible
  ```ts
  expect(result).toBe([value]) // Good

  expect(result).toHaveLength(1); // Bad
  expect(result[0]).toBe(value); // Bad
  ```

---

### 5 — Code Organization

- **O-1 (MUST)** Place code in `packages/shared` only if used by ≥ 2 packages.

---

### 6 — Tooling Gates

- **G-1 (MUST)** `prettier --check` passes.  
- **G-2 (MUST)** `turbo typecheck lint` passes.  

---

### 7 - Git

- **GH-1 (MUST**) Use Conventional Commits format when writing commit messages: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0
- **GH-2 (SHOULD NOT**) Refer to Claude or Anthropic in commit messages.

---

### 8 — Project-specific Rules

#### 8.1 ESP Copilot Rules
These rules tailor the general guidelines to the ESP Copilot mono-repo.

##### 8.1.1 UI & Visual Testing
* **PS-1 (MUST)** UI components (Shadcn/ui & Tailwind) may skip strict TDD provided they are covered by Storybook snapshots or Playwright visual-regression tests.

##### 8.1.2 Documentation & Comments
* **PS-2 (MUST)** Every exported function, React component, and Supabase edge function requires a concise JSDoc block explaining purpose, parameters, and example usage.

##### 8.1.3 Prompt Builders & Statistical Logic
* **PS-3 (MUST)** Prompt-construction helpers and statistical evaluators must have snapshot or property-based tests to guard against silent changes.

##### 8.1.4 Browser-extension Selectors
* **PS-4 (MUST)** Automation scripts must target `data-testid` or `data-esp-copilot` attributes. Fallback to class selectors only with accompanying e2e tests.

##### 8.1.5 Secrets & Configuration
* **PS-5 (MUST)** Secrets (API keys, tokens) **must** come from environment variables managed by Supabase Functions, Vercel, or GitHub Actions secrets. Never commit secrets to the repo. `git-secrets` or equivalent hook enforces this.

##### 8.1.6 LLM Usage
* **PS-6 (MUST)** Use `o3` model for planning chat flows; use `GPT-4o` for execution tasks. Budget enforcement logic must live in `packages/backend/ai-budget.ts` and have unit tests.

#### 8.2 ReadFlow Rules
These rules tailor the general guidelines to the ReadFlow project.

##### 8.2.1 Email Processing & Conversion
* **RF-1 (MUST)** Email processing functions must handle malformed HTML gracefully and log conversion failures.
* **RF-2 (MUST)** HTML-to-Kindle conversion must preserve article metadata (title, author, date).
* **RF-3 (MUST)** Email parsing must support major newsletter platforms (Substack, Medium, ConvertKit).
* **RF-4 (SHOULD)** Test email processing with real newsletter samples from different platforms.

##### 8.2.2 Kindle Integration
* **RF-5 (MUST)** Kindle delivery must include retry logic for failed deliveries.
* **RF-6 (MUST)** Validate Kindle email addresses before attempting delivery.
* **RF-7 (SHOULD)** Support multiple Kindle devices per user account.

##### 8.2.3 User Experience
* **RF-8 (MUST)** Dashboard must clearly show usage statistics and remaining quota.
* **RF-9 (MUST)** Personal email addresses must be prominently displayed and easily copyable.
* **RF-10 (SHOULD)** Provide clear error messages for failed conversions or deliveries.

##### 8.2.4 Security & Privacy
* **RF-11 (MUST)** Never store email content permanently; delete after conversion and delivery.
* **RF-12 (MUST)** Use environment variables for all API keys and sensitive configuration.
* **RF-13 (MUST)** Validate user permissions before processing emails or accessing data.

##### 8.2.5 Performance
* **RF-14 (MUST)** Email processing must complete within 5 minutes.
* **RF-15 (MUST)** Kindle delivery must complete within 10 minutes.
* **RF-16 (SHOULD)** Implement rate limiting for email processing to prevent abuse.

## Writing Functions Best Practices

When evaluating whether a function you implemented is good or not, use this checklist:

1. Can you read the function and HONESTLY easily follow what it's doing? If yes, then stop here.
2. Does the function have very high cyclomatic complexity? (number of independent paths, or, in a lot of cases, number of nesting if if-else as a proxy). If it does, then it's probably sketchy.
3. Are there any common data structures and algorithms that would make this function much easier to follow and more robust? Parsers, trees, stacks / queues, etc.
4. Are there any unused parameters in the function?
5. Are there any unnecessary type casts that can be moved to function arguments?
6. Is the function easily testable without mocking core features (e.g. sql queries, redis, etc.)? If not, can this function be tested as part of an integration test?
7. Does it have any hidden untested dependencies or any values that can be factored out into the arguments instead? Only care about non-trivial dependencies that can actually change or affect the function.
8. Brainstorm 3 better function names and see if the current name is the best, consistent with rest of codebase.

IMPORTANT: you SHOULD NOT refactor out a separate function unless there is a compelling need, such as:
  - the refactored function is used in more than one place
  - the refactored function is easily unit testable while the original function is not AND you can't test it any other way
  - the original function is extremely hard to follow and you resort to putting comments everywhere just to explain it

## Writing Tests Best Practices

When evaluating whether a test you've implemented is good or not, use this checklist:

1. SHOULD parameterize inputs; never embed unexplained literals such as 42 or "foo" directly in the test.
2. SHOULD NOT add a test unless it can fail for a real defect. Trivial asserts (e.g., expect(2).toBe(2)) are forbidden.
3. SHOULD ensure the test description states exactly what the final expect verifies. If the wording and assert don’t align, rename or rewrite.
4. SHOULD compare results to independent, pre-computed expectations or to properties of the domain, never to the function’s output re-used as the oracle.
5. SHOULD follow the same lint, type-safety, and style rules as prod code (prettier, ESLint, strict types).
6. SHOULD express invariants or axioms (e.g., commutativity, idempotence, round-trip) rather than single hard-coded cases whenever practical. Use `fast-check` library e.g.
```
import fc from 'fast-check';
import { describe, expect, test } from 'vitest';
import { getCharacterCount } from './string';

describe('properties', () => {
  test('concatenation functoriality', () => {
    fc.assert(
      fc.property(
        fc.string(),
        fc.string(),
        (a, b) =>
          getCharacterCount(a + b) ===
          getCharacterCount(a) + getCharacterCount(b)
      )
    );
  });
});
```

7. Unit tests for a function should be grouped under `describe(functionName, () => ...`.
8. Use `expect.any(...)` when testing for parameters that can be anything (e.g. variable ids).
9. ALWAYS use strong assertions over weaker ones e.g. `expect(x).toEqual(1)` instead of `expect(x).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(1)`.
10. SHOULD test edge cases, realistic input, unexpected input, and value boundaries.
11. SHOULD NOT test conditions that are caught by the type checker.

## Remember Shortcuts

Remember the following shortcuts which the user may invoke at any time.

### QNEW

When I type "qnew", this means:

```
Understand all BEST PRACTICES listed in rules.md.
Your code SHOULD ALWAYS follow these best practices.
```

### QPLAN
When I type "qplan", this means:
```
Analyze similar parts of the codebase and determine whether your plan:
- is consistent with rest of codebase
- introduces minimal changes
- reuses existing code
```

## QCODE

When I type "qcode", this means:

```
Implement your plan and make sure your new tests pass.
Always run tests to make sure you didn't break anything else.
Always run `prettier` on the newly created files to ensure standard formatting.
Always run `turbo typecheck lint` to make sure type checking and linting passes.
```

### QCHECK

When I type "qcheck", this means:

```
You are a SKEPTICAL senior software engineer.
Perform this analysis for every MAJOR code change you introduced (skip minor changes):

1. rules.md checklist Writing Functions Best Practices.
2. rules.md checklist Writing Tests Best Practices.
3. rules.md checklist Implementation Best Practices.
```

### QCHECKF

When I type "qcheckf", this means:

```
You are a SKEPTICAL senior software engineer.
Perform this analysis for every MAJOR function you added or edited (skip minor changes):

1. rules.md checklist Writing Functions Best Practices.
```

### QCHECKT

When I type "qcheckt", this means:

```
You are a SKEPTICAL senior software engineer.
Perform this analysis for every MAJOR test you added or edited (skip minor changes):

1. rules.md checklist Writing Tests Best Practices.
```

### QUX

Output a comprehensive list of scenarios you would test, sorted by highest priority.
```

### QGIT

When I type "qgit", this means:

```
Add all changes to staging, create a commit, and push to remote.

Follow this checklist for writing your commit message:
- SHOULD use Conventional Commits format: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0
- SHOULD NOT refer to Claude or Anthropic in the commit message.
- SHOULD structure commit message as follows:
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
[optional body]
[optional footer(s)]
- commit SHOULD contain the following structural elements to communicate intent: 
fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the Angular convention) recommends build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.
footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided and follow a convention similar to git trailer format.
```

### QRF (ReadFlow Specific)

When I type "qrf", this means:

```
Focus specifically on ReadFlow requirements:
- Email processing and conversion quality
- Kindle integration and delivery reliability
- User experience and dashboard functionality
- Security and privacy considerations
- Performance requirements for email processing
```

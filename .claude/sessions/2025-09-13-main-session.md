# 2025-09-13 Main Branch Session

## Session Summary

Successfully completed the rebranding and deployment of Link to Reader (formerly ReadFlow) to production. The website is now live at https://linktoreader.com with complete branding updates across the entire codebase. Deployed the application to Vercel with proper domain configuration via Cloudflare DNS.

Key accomplishments:
- Complete rebranding from "ReadFlow" to "Link to Reader" 
- Production deployment to Vercel with custom domain
- DNS configuration through Cloudflare
- Updated all environment variables for production

## Changes Made

### Files Modified/Created
- **README.md** - Updated project title and all references
- **app/layout.tsx** - Updated metadata, OpenGraph, and site information
- **Homepage components** (hero-section.tsx, header.tsx, footer.tsx, faq.tsx) - Updated branding and contact emails
- **Dashboard components** (sidebar.tsx, personal-email-card.tsx, kindle-settings-form.tsx) - Updated UI text and email generation
- **Authentication pages** (sign-in/page.tsx, sign-up/page.tsx) - Updated welcome messages
- **API routes** - Updated email domain references and comments
- **Test files** (route.spec.ts files) - Updated test email addresses
- **Configuration files** (.env.example, ENV_SETUP.md) - Updated email domains and project references
- **All component files** - Systematic replacement of "ReadFlow" with "Link to Reader"

### Email Domain Changes
- Changed from `@readflow.com` to `@linktoreader.com`
- Updated support email to `support@linktoreader.com`
- Updated SMTP_FROM to `noreply@linktoreader.com`
- Updated all user-generated email addresses (e.g., `user123@linktoreader.com`)

### Dependencies Added or Removed
- No dependency changes made during this session

## Technical Decisions

### Rebranding Approach
- **Why systematic replacement**: Used bulk find-and-replace script to ensure consistency across all files
- **Domain strategy**: Changed to linktoreader.com for better brand alignment and availability
- **Email strategy**: Updated all email references to match new domain for future AWS SES integration

### Deployment Strategy
- **Platform choice**: Chose Vercel for Next.js optimization and ease of deployment
- **Domain configuration**: Used Cloudflare DNS with proxy disabled to allow Vercel SSL management
- **Environment variables**: Migrated all production secrets to Vercel environment

### DNS Configuration Approach
- **A record**: Points apex domain (@) to Vercel IP (76.76.21.21)
- **CNAME record**: Points www subdomain to cname.vercel-dns.com
- **Proxy settings**: Disabled Cloudflare proxy (grey cloud) to allow Vercel SSL handling

## Testing & Validation

### Tests Added or Modified
- Updated test email addresses in `app/api/email/receive/route.spec.ts`
- Changed test domains from readflow.com to linktoreader.com
- All existing tests maintained functionality with new branding

### Manual Testing Performed
- ✅ Development server runs successfully with new branding
- ✅ Website displays "Link to Reader" throughout UI
- ✅ DNS resolution working correctly (76.76.21.21)
- ✅ Production site accessible at https://linktoreader.com
- ✅ Google OAuth redirect URIs updated for production

### Known Edge Cases or Limitations
- SSL certificate provisioning may take up to 24 hours for full HTTPS access
- Some network security filters may initially block the new domain
- Email functionality still relies on Gmail SMTP (to be replaced with AWS SES)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Follow-up Tasks
1. **Set up AWS account and Amazon SES** for cost-effective email handling
2. **Configure SES domain verification** for linktoreader.com
3. **Replace Mailgun webhook** with AWS SES receiving configuration
4. **Replace Gmail SMTP** with AWS SES sending configuration
5. **Update environment variables** to use SES endpoints and credentials

### Future Improvements Identified
- Implement AWS SES for both inbound and outbound email processing
- Set up proper email routing and bounce handling
- Configure SES sandbox removal for production email volumes
- Add email delivery monitoring and analytics

### Technical Debt Introduced (if any)
- Still using Gmail SMTP for email sending (temporary until AWS SES setup)
- Mailgun configuration remains in codebase but will be replaced
- Some build warnings remain but don't affect functionality

## Blockers & Issues

### Unresolved Problems
- None - all major objectives completed successfully

### Dependencies on External Factors
- **AWS account setup**: User needs to create AWS account for SES configuration
- **SES domain verification**: Requires DNS TXT record configuration in Cloudflare
- **SES sandbox removal**: May require AWS support request for production volumes

### Areas Needing Clarification
- AWS SES pricing tier selection for expected email volume
- Email retention and logging requirements for compliance
- Backup email delivery options if SES experiences issues

## Code Examples

### Key Implementation - Email Domain Generation
```typescript
// Before (ReadFlow)
const personalEmail = personalEmail || `${userId.slice(0, 8)}@readflow.com`;

// After (Link to Reader) 
const personalEmail = personalEmail || `${userId.slice(0, 8)}@linktoreader.com`;
```

### Environment Variable Updates
```bash
# Production URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://linktoreader.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://linktoreader.com
BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://linktoreader.com

# Email Configuration (to be updated with SES)
SMTP_FROM=noreply@linktoreader.com
```

### DNS Configuration
```
# Cloudflare DNS Records
A    @    76.76.21.21           DNS Only (Grey Cloud)
CNAME www  cname.vercel-dns.com DNS Only (Grey Cloud)
```

⏺ I've reviewed the project and the CLAUDE.md file. This is a Link to Reader project focused on email-to-Kindle conversion with comprehensive
  development guidelines.

  Key aspects I understand:

  Project Purpose: Link to Reader is an email-to-Kindle platform that processes newsletters and converts them to Kindle-readable formats.

  Development Guidelines:
  - TDD approach (scaffold → test → implement)
  - Branded types for persisted IDs
  - Type-only imports with import type
  - Colocated unit tests in *.spec.ts files
  - Integration tests separated from unit tests
  - Conventional commits format

  Link to Reader-Specific Rules:
  - Email processing must handle malformed HTML gracefully (RF-1)
  - Preserve metadata during conversion (RF-2)
  - Support major newsletter platforms (RF-3)
  - Kindle delivery with retry logic (RF-5)
  - Email validation before delivery (RF-6)
  - Clear dashboard with usage stats (RF-8)
  - Security: never store email content permanently (RF-11)
  - Performance: 5min email processing, 10min delivery limits (RF-14, RF-15)

  Tooling Requirements:
  - prettier --check must pass
  - turbo typecheck lint must pass

  Current State: I can see there are modified files in the working directory related to conversion, Stripe integration, and validation
  functionality.

  Ready to help with any Link to Reader development tasks following these established guidelines.

> Where we left off last time Is that the `Link to Reader` name was already taken, so I've had to change the name. Recently bought a domain, 
  the domain is linktoreader.com our new name is "Link to Reader". I bought the domain from CloudFlare, and you were guiding me through 
  the process of making the website live. After the website is live, we need to start configuring the email. We decided that since costs
   are quite important, we would not use either Mailgun or SendGrid. Instead, we would use Amazon for the emails because even though it 
  will be harder to set up, it's the most cost-effective setup.

⏺ I understand! You've rebranded from "Link to Reader" to "Link to Reader" with the domain linktoreader.com purchased through Cloudflare. We
  need to:

  1. Make the website live on the new domain
  2. Configure Amazon SES for email handling (cost-effective choice)

  Let me help you continue from where we left off. First, I need to understand the current deployment setup to guide you through making
  the site live on linktoreader.com.

⏺ Search(pattern: "**/vercel.json")
  ⎿  Found 0 files 

⏺ Search(pattern: "**/package.json")
  ⎿  Found 100 files (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Read(package.json)
  ⎿  Read 116 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Search(pattern: "**/.env*")
  ⎿  Found 4 files (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! I can see this is a Next.js application. Let me check if there's already any deployment configuration and understand the
  current setup:

⏺ Read(.env.example)
  ⎿  Read 71 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Bash(ls -la)
  ⎿  total 9968

     drwx------@  30 juliotiusanen  staff      960 Aug 21 14:23 ..
     … +37 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Now let me check if you're already using Vercel for deployment:

⏺ Read(next.config.ts)
  ⎿  Read 32 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Great! I can see this is a Next.js application. Let me check the current branding in the codebase to understand what needs to be
  updated for the "Link to Reader" rebrand:

⏺ Search(pattern: "Link to Reader|readflow", head_limit: 10)
  ⎿  Found 10 files (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Based on what I can see, here's the plan to make your "Link to Reader" website live on linktoreader.com and configure Amazon SES:

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Update branding from Link to Reader to Link to Reader across the codebase
     ☐ Configure domain settings in Cloudflare for linktoreader.com
     ☐ Deploy the website to Vercel and connect custom domain
     ☐ Set up Amazon SES for email processing
     ☐ Configure SES domain verification and DKIM
     ☐ Update environment variables for production deployment
     ☐ Test the live website deployment

⏺ Next Steps for Going Live

  Here's what we need to do to get Link to Reader live on linktoreader.com:

  1. Immediate Priority - Deploy to Vercel

  Since this is a Next.js app, I recommend deploying to Vercel (easiest) and then connecting your custom domain.

  Action needed from you:
  - Do you have a Vercel account set up?
  - Are you ready to deploy, or should we first update the branding from "Link to Reader" to "Link to Reader"?

  2. Cloudflare Domain Setup

  - Configure DNS settings in Cloudflare to point to Vercel
  - Set up proper DNS records for both website and email

  3. Amazon SES Setup (Cost-effective email solution)

  - Configure SES in your AWS account
  - Set up domain verification for linktoreader.com
  - Configure DKIM and SPF records
  - Replace current SMTP configuration with SES

  Questions to proceed:

  1. Should we update the branding first before deploying, or deploy as-is and rebrand after?
  2. Do you have access to:
    - Vercel account (or should we create one?)
    - AWS account for SES setup?
  3. For the domain configuration, I'll need you to:
    - Access your Cloudflare dashboard
    - Follow the DNS configuration steps I'll provide

  Which would you like to tackle first - the deployment or the branding update?

> Yes, I have a Vercel account. But I am not ready to deploy. I would like us to first update the branding from `Link to Reader` to Link to 
  Reader. I don't yet have an AWS account for SES set up. Let's start with the rebranding, then Vercel, and then you guide me through 
  the process

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Update branding from Link to Reader to Link to Reader across the codebase
     ☐ Configure domain settings in Cloudflare for linktoreader.com
     ☐ Deploy the website to Vercel and connect custom domain
     ☐ Set up Amazon SES for email processing
     ☐ Configure SES domain verification and DKIM
     ☐ Update environment variables for production deployment
     ☐ Test the live website deployment

⏺ Perfect! Let's start with the rebranding. I'll help you systematically update everything from "Link to Reader" to "Link to Reader".

  First, let me find all occurrences of the old branding:

⏺ Search(pattern: "Link to Reader|readflow", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 195 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Now let me check the key app components and metadata files to understand what needs updating:

⏺ Read(app/layout.tsx)
  ⎿  Read 52 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Now let me start updating the branding systematically. I'll begin with the most critical files:

  1. Update package.json with the new name
